**OpenPKI: A Fair, Transparent, and Accessible Trust System for All**

The current certification system under the CAB Forum is expensive, opaque, and hard to access. OpenPKI is a vision of an alternative that replaces money and bureaucracy with transparency, simplicity, and openness.

**Part 1: The Central Registry & CA Submission System**

OpenPKI defines a central, publicly accessible registry for certificate authorities (CAs) that all browsers and clients can consult. Instead of costly audits, transparency becomes the new currency of trust.

CAs register via a standardized, user-friendly web form, including fields like:

* Full name of the owner/operator
* (Optional) Date of birth / age
* Address of the owner and optionally of the CA
* Key generation method and security level (RSA, ECC, bits)
* Hosting location and infrastructure details
* Other involved persons (staff, project members, etc.)
* Commercial or free operation
* Planned validation levels (DV, OV, EV)
* Price info & issuance of intermediates

The entire system is **completely free of charge**. No audits, no license fees – just maximum openness.

**Part 2: Clear Visualization of Trust Levels**

Each validation level (DV, OV, EV) gets a clearly recognizable visual identity. Users can instantly tell what level of trust a certificate holds:

* **DV (free):** Black or white padlock (as seen today)
* **DV (paid):** Fully blue padlock
* **OV:** Turquoise with an orange border (final color to be community-voted)
* **EV:** Green padlock with optional banner (enabled by default, smaller than legacy EV indicators)

This results in an intuitive and transparent user experience – no need to dig into certificate details.

**Part 3: Fair Conditions for Everyone**

OpenPKI doesn't just stand for openness – it also calls for **reform**:

* Dramatic **cost reduction for business registration** (by 90–95%) to make EV accessible
* Elimination of pointless middlemen and overpriced notary bureaucracy
* Standardized, digital application forms
* Automated verification via eID or blockchain

EV certificates should be based on **real legal identity**, not money. Business license for OV, company registration number for EV – that’s enough. No more audits, just clarity.

**OpenPKI aims to bring trust back to where it belongs: in the hands of the people.**
